<h1>Welcome to @kimmidesigns</h1>

<p>
I am
</p>

Growing up I always expressed a love for art- drawing, painting, and ceramics are big with me.
I took every possible class I could.  I served in the Army as an IT Specialist and a webmaster.
After my service I decided to change career paths and go into graphic design.
And boy am I happy I did, I absolutely love this field!  I am passionate about my work and put a lot of thought and energy into it, but move at a fast pace.
I enjoy working alone or with a team depending on the projects needs.
